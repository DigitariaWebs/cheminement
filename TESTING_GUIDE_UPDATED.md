## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Problem 1: Can't See Payment Form in Modal**

**Symptoms:**
- Modal opens but no payment form appears
- Just see "Preparing payment..." forever
- Or error message appears

**Check Console (F12 → Console tab):**
Look for errors related to:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Stripe.js loading issues

**Common Causes:**
1. **Missing or wrong publishable key**
   - Check `.env`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...`
   - MUST start with `pk_test_`
   - MUST have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

2. **Using secret key instead of publishable key**
   - Publishable: `pk_test_...` ✅
   - Secret: `sk_test_...` ❌ (backend only!)

3. **Didn't restart dev server after adding env var**
   - Stop server (`Ctrl+C`)
   - Run `npm run dev` again

**Fix:**
```bash
# In .env file
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

---

### **Problem 2: "Failed to Create Payment Intent" Error**

**Symptoms:**
- Modal shows error: "Failed to initialize payment"
- Console shows 500 error from `/api/payments/create-intent`

**Check Terminal Logs:**
Look at your dev server terminal for errors.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Wrong secret key (using publishable key as secret)**
   ```bash
   # WRONG:
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=pk_test_xxx  ❌
   
   # CORRECT:
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx  ✅
   ```

2. **Get the correct secret key:**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - Find "Secret key" row
   - Click **"Reveal test key"**
   - Copy the key starting with `sk_test_`

3. **MongoDB connection issue**
   - Check `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`
   - Make sure database is accessible

**Fix:**
```bash
# In .env file
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

---

### **Problem 3: Payment Succeeds but Status Still "Pending"**

**This is NORMAL without webhook setup!**

**What Happened:**
- ✅ Payment processed successfully in Stripe
- ❌ Your app didn't receive webhook notification
- ❌ Database wasn't auto-updated

**Verification:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Payments
2. If payment shows "Succeeded" → **Payment worked!** ✅
3. The money is collected, just status didn't update in your app

**To Fix (Optional - for auto-status updates):**
Set up webhooks - see "Webhook Setup" section below

**For Now:**
You can manually verify all payments in Stripe Dashboard. For testing purposes, this is fine!

---

### **Problem 4: Card Declined / Payment Failed**

**Make sure you're using the correct test card:**

| Card Number | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Success (always) |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | ❌ Declined |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | ❌ Insufficient funds |
| `4000 0025 0000 3155` | 🔒 Requires 3D Secure |

**Use:** `4242 4242 4242 4242` for basic testing

---

### **Problem 5: No Professionals to Book With**

**This means you skipped Part 1!**

You need to create a professional account first.

**Solution:**
1. Logout from client account
2. Go back to Part 1 of this guide
3. Create professional account
4. Then logout and login as client again

---

### **Problem 6: Appointment Not Created**

**Check:**
1. Did you select a primary concern? (required field)
2. Did you select both date AND time?
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
4. Check terminal logs for API errors

**Common Issues:**
- Date in the past
- Time slot already taken
- Database connection issue

---

## 🔗 **OPTIONAL: Webhook Setup**

To make appointment status auto-update to "paid", you need webhooks.

### **Why Webhooks?**

Without webhooks:
- Payment succeeds in Stripe ✅
- Your app doesn't know about it ❌
- Status stays "pending" ❌

With webhooks:
- Payment succeeds in Stripe ✅
- Stripe notifies your app ✅
- Status auto-updates to "paid" ✅

### **Local Development Webhook Setup**

**Step 1: Install Stripe CLI**

**Windows (Scoop):**
```powershell
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe
```

**Windows (Direct Download):**
1. Download from: https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest
2. Extract `stripe.exe`
3. Add to PATH or use from download folder

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

---

**Step 2: Login to Stripe CLI**

```bash
stripe login
```
- Browser will open
- Click "Allow access"
- Return to terminal

---

**Step 3: Forward Webhooks**

Open a **SECOND TERMINAL** (keep dev server running in first):

```powershell
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook
```

You should see:
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

**Step 4: Copy Webhook Secret**

1. Copy the `whsec_xxxxx` shown in terminal
2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
3. Restart your dev server (in first terminal):
   - Press `Ctrl+C`
   - Run `npm run dev` again

---

**Step 5: Keep Both Running**

While testing with webhooks, you need:
- ✅ Terminal 1: `npm run dev` (dev server)
- ✅ Terminal 2: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook`

---

**Step 6: Test Payment Again**

1. Create a new appointment (or use existing pending one)
2. Make payment with test card
3. **Watch the Stripe CLI terminal (Terminal 2)**
4. You should see:
   ```
   --> payment_intent.succeeded [200]
   ```
5. Check appointment status → Should now show **"Paid"** ✅

---
